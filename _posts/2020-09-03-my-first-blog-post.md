Python only has a for loop and a while loop.  This makes recursion more important than ever.  Recursion is simply a function calling itelf.
A factorial function is the prime example of this.  To stop recursion, it is necessary to have a base case that will be reached.  Otherwise, you get
infinite recursion.  

The lack of loops in Python is more problematic for retrieving data than writing functions.  Nested data is a nightmare and sometimes the best way to visualize a 
solution is by rewriting the data into a matrice.
